# Spark Compressive Genomics

SCG (Spark Compressive Genomics) is a Spark framework implementing distributed
data structures used to maintainin genomic sequences in a compressed format. The
compression allows to increase the size of the data that fit the RAM. In addition, the
framework includes transformations able to act directly on the compressed data, saving
space and time from the data decompression.
